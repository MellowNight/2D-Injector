# 2D-injector
2D Injector: An AetherVisor-based DLL manual mapper that I wanted to use on Battleye games. This was tested and is undetected on Fortnite and EFT, but the major caveat was injector caused FPS drops with cheats.

I can see this being used for things other than cheating, such as debugging heavily protected apps or hiding from EDR.
